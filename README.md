# Food Delivery
## Introduction
Food delivery is a courier service in which a restaurant, store, or independent food-delivery company delivers food to a customer. 
An order is typically made either through a restaurant or grocer's website or mobile app, or through a food ordering company. 
The delivered items can include entrees, sides, drinks, desserts, or grocery items and are typically delivered in boxes or bags. 
The delivery person will normally drive a car, but in bigger cities where homes and restaurants are closer together, they may use bikes or motorized scooters.


## Objectives
Correctly categorize and clean data by addressing errors and converting columns with incorrect data types. <br>
Add and remove multiple columns to optimize the dataset for model performance, improving the quality of the data used in training. <br>
Conduct an hyperparameter search and visualize the model's performance across different parameter settings to fine-tune the model for optimal results.

## This repository includes the following:
Performed EDA, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and visualizations to optimize model performance. (Food_delivery.ipynb) <br>

## Summary :
We have a dataframe with 46000 labels and 20 features (one to predict)
